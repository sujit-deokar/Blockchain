    "    Let's dig into this statement a bit further. It is extremely hard to change the transactions in a blockchain, because each block is linked to the previous block by including the previous block's hash. This hash includes the Merkle root hash of all the transactions in the previous block. If a single transaction were to change, not only would the Merkle root hash change, but so too would the hash contained in the changed block. In addition, each subsequent block would need to be updated to reflect this change. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's look at an example of how this works. In the following diagram, we see the original blocks and the transactions for Block 11. Specifically, we see that the Merkle root for the transactions in Block 11 is **Hash #ABCD**, which is the combined hash for the four transactions in this block. Now, let's say that someone comes in and attempts to change Transaction A to Transaction A'. This, in turn, modifies the hashes that are stored in the Merkle tree, and the Merkle root changes to **Hash #A'BCD**. In addition, the Previous Block hash stored in Block 12 also needs to be modified to reflect the overall change in the hash for Block 11.\n",
